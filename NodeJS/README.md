The NodeJS example provided in R1_RESTful_API.js uses the following libraries:
node-rest-client (npm install node-rest-client)
mongodb (https://www.mongodb.org)

The project has examples for most key functions of the API as both GET and POSTS.
There is no requirement to utilize MongoDB for the project, simply leave that code remarked out and/or remove as you see fit.

Future:
Will add code to read/write output from/to csv files for ease of integration.
